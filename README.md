# Book-Rental-ASP.NET-App

This is a simple book rental web application. This is my first ASP .NET project where I explored the concept of Code First Migration, used NuGet Package Manager, Razor syntax, and built APIs for returning data from server to the client. I also used popular JavaScript libraries like DataTable, and Twitterâ€™s Typeahead JavaScript library.
